# CompassApp

The Compass App is a comprehensive full-stack application that I designed and developed to assist me in having a structured, organized, and efficient lifestyle. Originally created as a Java application in 2022, I later transformed it into a React Native application to enhance its functionality and accessibility. This app acts as my compass and guides me in the right direction to achieve all personal and professional goals. I use the Compass App daily, and it has significantly contributed to my growth across all areas of life. This application includes various useful features such as a Todo List, Budget Tracker, Diet Tracker, and a framework for setting and tracking weekly, monthly, and yearly goals. I will go through the app's key features, explain their impact on my life, and provide insights into technical implementation details.
