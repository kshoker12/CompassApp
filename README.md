# CompassApp

The Compass App is a comprehensive full-stack application that I designed and developed to assist me in having a structured, organized, and efficient lifestyle. Originally created as a Java application in 2022, I later transformed it into a React Native application to enhance its functionality and accessibility. This app acts as my compass and guides me in the right direction to achieve all personal and professional goals. I use the Compass App daily, and it has significantly contributed to my growth across all areas of life. This application includes various useful features such as a Todo List, Budget Tracker, Diet Tracker, and a framework for setting and tracking weekly, monthly, and yearly goals. I will go through the app's key features, explain their impact on my life, and provide insights into technical implementation details.

### Todo List

<div style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start; gap: 20px;" align = "left">
  <img 
    src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/79dd2b0a-edd1-407c-bc28-1219df1c7ded" 
    width="200" 
    alt="Todo List Demo"
    align = "right"
  />
  <p>
    The Todo List section allows me to systematically get difficult tasks done by breaking it down into sub-tasks, which I finish one hour at a time. 
    The app tracks how many hours I spent on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis. Whenever I finish an hour of work, the app logs the hour and also tracks 
    which responsibility the task was for, such as Training, Career, or a University Course. I can add tasks to the Todo List by selecting subtasks 
    from my responsibilities. The demo below illustrates how the Todo List component works.

  <p>
    The Diet Tracker section allows me to monitor my nutritional intake systematically by logging meals and tracking their macronutrient content. 
    The app provides daily, weekly, and monthly summaries of my dietary habits and helps me stay on track with my fitness and health goals. 
    The demo below illustrates how the Diet Tracker component works.
